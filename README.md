Seamless video experience with floating video mode. Simply click on the extension icon to begin. It is draggable, resizable, has a play/pause button, an exit button, and a return to tab button.

It uses built-in Google Chrome PIP API so it should work on every website.

1. Add the icon to the top right of your browser by pinning it. Then click on it.
