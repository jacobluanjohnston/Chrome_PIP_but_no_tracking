Seamless video experience with floating video mode. Simply click on the extension icon to begin. It is draggable, resizable, has a play/pause button, an exit button, and a return to tab button.

It uses built-in Google Chrome PIP API, so it should work on every website. However, unlike https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/picture-in-picture-chrome-extension, we do not run trackers that collects and sends data to Google Analytics or run pop-ups. Google tracks various user interactions such as page views, events, transactions, and social interactions on a website ultimately to improve their application, however, my code will be doing none of that.

You don't have to give me credit for using this code.

1. Add the icon to the top right of your browser by pinning it. Then click on it.
